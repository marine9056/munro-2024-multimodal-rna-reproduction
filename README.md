# Reproduction of Multimodal RNA Analysis (Munro et al., 2024)

## Overview
This project reproduces a key supplementary analysis from:
**Munro et al., Nature Communications (2024)**  
using the original supplementary data and R.

The goal is to demonstrate reproducible bioinformatics workflows,
data cleaning of real-world supplementary files, and publication-grade visualization.

## Methods
- Data source: Supplementary Data 2 (Nature Communications, 2024)
- Tools: R, tidyverse, readxl, ggplot2, viridis
- Analysis:
  - Cleaning and restructuring supplementary Excel data
  - Selecting top 15 tissues by total detected genes
  - Visualizing multimodal gene discovery across tissues

## Output
